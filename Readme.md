#Musical Melee

##Creating music with Super Smash Brothers Melee

##What does it do?

This project allows you to customize the sounds coming out of Super Smash Brothers Melee. Information about what is happening on screen is pulled out from memory.

This data includes:
+ Character X position
+ Character Y position
+ Character stocks remaining
+ Character percent
+ Current stage
+ Jumps left

And much more.

###How was it built?

It is built using C++ and [ChucK](http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu)

The two languages communicate over the [Open Sound Control (OSC)] (http://opensoundcontrol.org/) protocol.

It was built off of the work done by github user altf4 on his [SmashBot] (https://github.com/altf4/SmashBot) AI project.

###What do I need to use it?

+ A mac or linux computer. We hope to be able to run on Windows sometime in the future.
+ ChucK, a free audio programming language.

Mac: you can install it with [homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
```
brew install chuck
```

Linux: your package manager may have a copy
+ fedora
  ```
  dnf install chuck
  ```
+ ubuntu
  ```
  apt-get install chuck
  ```
  
If you are having trouble installing or looking for an alternative method, check out the ChucK documentation [here] (http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/doc/build/).

+ A copy of the [Dolphin](https://dolphin-emu.org/) wii/gamecube emulator, version 5.0 or later.
+ A copy of Super Smash Bros. Melee v1.02 NTSC.
+ Apply the Melee Netplay Community Settings Gecko Code. Right click on the iso -> properties -> Gecko Codes -> Netplay Community Settings.
+ Enable cheats in Dolphin. Config -> General -> Enable Cheats
+ Lastly, you may want a gamecube controller and an adapter for use on your computer.

###I have that stuff, now what?

+ Download or clone this project to your computer. 

(the "smashbot" branch is similar to "master" but also includes the smashbot AI)
+ Inside of the project folder, run
```
make
```
+ Then, run the MME executable
```
./mme
```
+ And then the ChucK program (probably in another terminal window)
```
chuck main.ck
```
+ Start up Dolphin and mute sound. Config -> Audio -> Volume -> 0%
+ Start up Melee and the sound effects will kick in once you start a fight.

### I can't get it to work!
Musical Melee is still a young project and will likely be changing quite often. Please be patient as we update and fix issues.
